## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1 Part 1
This was my favorite lab, here we learned about Hello World. I had no idea what it was until that first lab. Another reason it is my favorite, is because we learned about git, and how to open, copy, and submit code using it. Although git was very hard to get used to, getting this introduction here with the basic commands such as git push, git commit, git clone, ls, and cd. Especially since this was the way we NEEDED to submit our labs, it was a good way to start us off in the semester. The lab was also very simple which is why i enjoyed it.

* Lab 6 Part 1
This was also one of my favorite labs becuase its the one that taught me how to use if statements. I also enjoyed the putting together the sandwich with the different parts (bread, meat, condiments etc). Although this lab gave me a headach, and although the grade for it was not the best, I still enjoyed. I also got used to listing the arguments in this lab, this was helpful for the future labs which used the same concepts and ideas. It also prepared me for the exams as well.

* Lab 7 Part 2
I enjoyed this lab the most probably, simply because i enjoyed the complexity of it. It almost seemed like a puzzle and my partner and I were brainstorming on how to accomplish the code. ALthough it took us some time, we were able to figure out how to use the bool operator. What made it fun, was having the signs to tell us our restrictions, and us having to work with them and figuring it out. This was also the first lab that helped me understand the bool operator, during lecture I was a bit lost, however my partner and i were able to get it.
